Project notes:

Not sure if I should return a new vector and matrix in the math classes or if I should edit the passed object (also remove math classes and create subclasses)
Need to call Matrix.setDecimalFormat() before matrix is created
Maybe I should merge the math classes with their object's class to allow for method chaining

Decided to use OpenGL over Java3D, because it interfaces closer to the graphics card. Due to the OpenGL API being written in C, I have
decided to use LWJGL as a wrapper. This library provides many other functions, including math, which is optimized with OpenCL. Some packages
I have written will either be re-written or removed in light of this new addition.
